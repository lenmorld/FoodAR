DESIGN DECISIONS

removed for now

[X] image-capture module (captures last base64 image captured, keeps it in mem, and
displays in top right corner after successful "turnaround")

[/] added AR content -> FoofItemName and NutritionalInfo

[/] upgraded Heroku dyno?



DOCU

-> can include brief three.js X,Y,Z axis
even just the pic

-> simple mock (like the one drawn in paper)


-> LECTURES : scan for possibly relevant topic to relate here
e.g. Fitt's law may not apply, but [AR framework] on 1st week would definitely be the backbone
    of discussion
